# Recovery watchdog -- runs ON THE VM, triggered every 2 minutes by
# genre-watchdog.timer (systemd). Detects when either product has stopped
# responding and restarts it, logging and notifying Discord.
#
# This handles the "process/service crashed or hung" failure mode. It cannot
# recover from the *entire VM* being wiped (nothing would be left to run this
# script) -- that case is handled by re-running deploy.sh from your local
# machine (see docs/RECOVERY.md for the optional external-checker fallback).
